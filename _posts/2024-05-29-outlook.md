## Weakness

It is a vulnerability discovered in Outlook that allows reading network resources, thus exposing possible NTLM hashes. For this, a **phishing** attack is necessary since the user must at least view the email.

## exploit

[CVE-2024-21413](https://github.com/xaitax/CVE-2024-21413-Microsoft-Outlook-Remote-Code-Execution-Vulnerability)

### Usage

We need to send an email with embedded malicious code. When the user checks this email, it will try to open shared resources using NTLM hashes

Review the official exploit document to use this exploit. On the attacker machine, open <code>responder -i &#60;interface&#62;</code> to capture NTML hashes and crack them.
