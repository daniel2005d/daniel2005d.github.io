# Python

The smtpd module in Python is a built-in module that provides an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server implementation. It allows you to create your own SMTP server in Python, which can receive incoming emails and process them according to your requirements. With the smtpd module, you can handle email delivery, implement custom email processing logic, and even build email testing environments. It's a versatile tool for working with email-related tasks in Python applications.

```python
python3 -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer 0.0.0.0:25
```

# swaks

```bash
sudo swaks  -t "TO" --from "FROM"  --attach @filename --server "mailServer" --body @File.txt -header "Subject"
```
```bash
--suppress-data -ap
sudo swaks -t "TO" --from "FROM" --server "mailServer" --body "\\\\&#60;remotehost&#62;\" -a LOGIN 

-t: Destination email
--from: From email
